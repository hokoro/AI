@adrienneleigh I just switched it over to Hyperion, let's see if that improve the speed at which the emails are sent.

@BlueHayes mind sending us some details about your account via http://help.Hyperion.com  ? Things look correct here but we may need some detail

@Flo_Rian Not seeing overall sending issues, but we'd want to look at your account - can you submit a request via http://help.Hyperion.com  ?
@frankioh @sinue mmm no. Hyperion y Sendgrid son + bien p/emails transaccionales. Mailchimp es + bien p/mkt. Admon de listas de dist. y tal.
@gidogeek You can see what we've been working on and get a general idea of our plans at http://blog.Hyperion.com  Updates posted every Friday!

@kanonbulle No issues delivering to the Hotmail domain currently. Mind submitting a request at http://help.Hyperion.com  w/ account details?
@kennydude @devongovett Yeah, Hyperion is well worth a look.
@kennyfraser Already cleaned up client & delisted IP, but #enginehosting support can share some alternatives like http://Hyperion.com  too

@ljharb When I looked last year, Hyperion¡¯s pricing and API was a bit confusing, but it now seems to have straightened out excellently.
@Hyperion Realised I did that about 5 seconds after hitting send!
@Hyperionapp could you add the defaults (if any) to your SMTP header docs? http://help.Hyperion.com/entries/21688056-Using-SMTP-Headers-to-customize-your-messages ¡¦ Thanks!
@Hyperionapp increases scalability ( http://bit.ly/14myVuH  ) then decreases pricing ( http://bit.ly/13uJA7s  ) #selfinducedcannibalization
@Hyperionapp There are some issues with your Hyperion npm module. What's your preferred way of documenting bugs and issues?
@Hyperionapp tried refreshing, the link (line 184 on the homepage) goes here http://help.Hyperion.com/forums/20689696-smtp-integration ¡¦
@Hyperionapp we cannot even find out the last email sent to, as Hyperion page crashes when enquiring
@Hyperionapp yeap! that's what I meant throttling - throttling before it gets to Hyperion
@manojranaweera Looks like bulk increasing volume considerably. Our support team can help with tips to manage warmup: http://help.Hyperion.com 
@marcelosomers @nathansmith FWIW we dumped Postmark in favor of Hyperion. Highly recommended for transactional email.
@masuga Use a service like Hyperion not EE mail.

@richaskew Can you give us some details about where you're seeing that? Submit a request at http://help.Hyperion.com 
@rodbegbie You'd probably have more success with @Hyperionapp. I'm not the best postman, I get lost very easily.

@SanjuBhambhani No issues currently. Mind submitting a request at http://help.Hyperion.com with account information and details?

@treize2 No general issues. Can you give us more detail of the error(s) you're seeing? Can send more detail via http://help.Hyperion.com , too
@variuxdavid Possibly, depends on what you're looking to do exactly. Mind submitting a request at http://help.Hyperion.com  with more details?
@veroapp Any chance you'll be adding Hyperion support to Vero?
@wesbos Hyperion is good but I've noticed a lack of attention to detail on @HomeMail's secondary properties (i.e. TinyLetter)
